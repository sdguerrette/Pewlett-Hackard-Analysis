# Employee Database Chalenge
## Overview
This analysis was conducted on behalf of Pewlett Hackard to provide data that will help them prepare for the future as a large number of their employees begin to reach retirement age. To prepare for this "Silver Tsunami," the company requested information on the number of employees who will reach retirement age within the next 3 years, as well as their title and department. Also, to help mitigate the loss of so many experienced people, they have asked for information regarding the feasibility of launching a mentorship program to train and foster the development of new hires. Those eligible for the program are currently employees who are ten years from retirement age.
## Results
  * There are 72,458 employees who will reach retirement age within the next three years.
  * These employees can be broken down by title as follows:

## Summary
At the highest leve;, managment is interested in answering the following two questions: how many roles need to be filled as the "Silver Tsumami" hits the company, and are there enough mentorship-eligible employees to help train the many replacement workers that will need to be hired?
&nbsp;

An astounding 72,458 Pewlett Hackerd employees are likely to retire in the next three years, with 54,447 of those employees (75.14%) holding titles at either the "Leader", "Senior", or "Manager" levels. 
&nbsp;

With such large losses at the top-end of the company, it is extremely important to get new hires up-to-speed as quickly and effeciently as possible. The mentorship program will help in this endeavor, however we do not believe it will be enough. With the current eligibility requirements, each mentor would have to take on 46 mentees over the next 3 years, which is too many to feasibly allow the mentor to continue to work in his or her current role while also participating in the program.  
&nbsp;
While not originally included in the scope of this project, we believe that the following to tables will add much-needed clarity on where to focus the employee-replacement efforts.
  * The following table breaks down retirement eligibility by department, which will help the company's recruiters target the right type of employees.

   * The following table breaksdown the projected retirement numbers by birth year. As shown, the distribution across years is fairly even for 1953, 1954, and 1955. However, 1952 is over 1000 employees fewer. This means that the company will have to have a steady stream of new recruits over the next three to four years, but the first year of the "Silver Tsunami" will allow for a little bit of breathing room.
